### Use Bitnami WAMP Stack 
The Bitnami WAMP Stack is an easy to install software platform that greatly simplifies the deployment of Open Source web stacks. It includes ready-to-run versions of Apache, MySQL and PHP.

  - Upload sql to phpMyAdmin that supports MySQL-compatible databases.
  - Locate Bitnami->wampstack->apache2->htdocs directory
  - Place the code in the directory
  - Go to a web browswer and start run the php files.
